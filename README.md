# PyBer_Analysis

# Analysis Overview :

In this analysis, we are analyzing all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 in Urban, Suburban and Rural cities and creating a compelling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize, of Pyber, a ridesharing company. The dataset, city data and ride data include city types, total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. Our aim is to create a multiple lines graph to visualize total weekly fares for above mentioned period and help CEO to determine any disparities among various city types.

After calculating all the metrics and combining them into one dataframe, we can see that Urabn cities had highest number of ride count, drivers count and fares. However, average fare per ride and driver is comparably lower than Rural and Suburban. It can bee seen that Rural cities had lowest number of rides, drivers count and fares but it had highest amount of average fare per ride and driver as compared to other. Even though we are comparing three different city types where customers and demands are different, we see a particular trend that is, as the number of rides, drivers and total fares increase, the average fare per ride and per drivers also starts to decrease. This can be further supported by pie charts.
