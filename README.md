# PyBer_Analysis

# Analysis Overview :

In this analysis, we are analyzing all the rideshare data from January to early May of 2019 in Urban, Suburban and Rural cities and creating a compelling visualization for the CEO, V. Isualize, of Pyber, a ridesharing company. The dataset, city data and ride data include city types, total rides, total drivers, total fares, average fare per ride and driver, and total fare by city type. Our aim is to create a multiple lines graph to visualize total weekly fares for above mentioned period and help CEO to determine any disparities among various city types.

After calculating all the metrics and combining them into one dataframe, we can see that Urabn cities had highest number of ride count, drivers count and fares. Pyber gets 62.7% of its fares from Urban cities as compared to 30.5% and 6.8% from Suburban and Rural cities respectively. However, average fare per ride and driver in Urban is comparably lower than Rural and Suburban. It can bee seen that Rural cities had lowest number of rides, drivers and fares but it had highest amount of average fare per ride and driver as compared to other. Also, in the following line chart, we can see all three city types saw an increase in fares in late February, while most of the time, the graph keeps fluctuating. And then in early weeks of April, we see a spike in fares in Suburban.

Even though we are comparing three different city types where customers and demands are different, we see a particular trend that is, as the number of rides, drivers and total fares increase, the average fare per ride and per drivers also starts to decrease. This can be further supported by pie charts.

# Summary and Recommendations :

From above dataframe and different pie charts, following conclusions and recommendations can be drawn:

1) Urban cities have highest amount of total fares and drivers which results in high ride counts. However, the company should notice that Urban cities account for 68.4% of total rides with 62.7% of total fares. Company should further develop strategies to maintain the manpower and improve average fares per ride and drivers. It can be seen, Pyber has ample amount of drivers already in Urban cities.

2) Rural cities account for only 5.3% of total rides with just 6.8% of total fares but average fare per rides and drivers is the highest. This is maybe because of long travel distance and lesser number of drivers. Pyber should look to invest in Rural cities as it has good potential. If the company try to market their services better and recruit more manpower accordingly, it can definitely improve on total fares and also it might perform better in terms of total rides. 

3) As for Suburban, it stands quite neutral. It accounts for 26.3% of total rides with 30.5% of total fares. Suburban cities look balanced in terms average fares per ride and drivers as compared to other two. Pyber can look to increase the number of drivers to improve rides and total fares. Moreover, Pyber can focus on Urban and Rural cities first.
